Questions for reviewers:
* How should we use a dataset that is already analyzed? Can we incorporate the analysis in our own report?
* What should we be mindful of when combining different data points into a dataset for our project?
* What constitutes a dataset idea that’s too narrow/broad in scope?
* Should we go into the project with any idea of what specifically we hope to discover, or just let the data analysis reveal insights?
